## MIP/DLP - Trainable Classifiers Survey

The Compliance engineering team at Microsoft is working to expand classification capabilities in Microsoft 365 Compliance solutions. Our Machine-learning based Trainable Classifiers are a key component of this solution that can be used to detect information that is relevant to specific actions you might want to take on content across different solutions including Automatic labeling, Information Governance, and Communication Compliance. We are working both to expand the use of trainable classifiers to additional workloads and to provide additional classifiers to address new business-centric scenarios in each of these workloads. 
 
In order to prioritize this work, we need your insights regarding the potential value of each of the classifiers we are considering for MIP.
 
Please provide your responses to the following survey - [https://ncv.microsoft.com/NkKbIZWPmV](https://ncv.microsoft.com/NkKbIZWPmV) 


## MIG - Trainable Classifiers Survey

New out-of-the-box trainable classifiers for Information Governance and Records Management

Please respond to the survey here: [https://aka.ms/MIG-AI](https://aka.ms/MIG-AI)

Microsoft is planning to offer more built-in, ready-use out-of-box classifiers in our compliance solutions. You can use these machine-learning trainable classifiers to automatically detect, classify, retain/delete, and manage content, even if you do not know where the content is located in Microsoft 365.

We want to seek your input on the types of data that may benefit from these trainable classifiers. Thank you in advance for taking the time to share your feedback and insights. We take customer feedback seriously and use it to prioritize what we build in our products.

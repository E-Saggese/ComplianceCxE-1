# Privacy Policy

**TL;DR**: This site does not use cookies to track you and this site does not directly collect any data that can be used to identify you.

When we launched our site, we wanted to provide a transparent and privacy-focused experience for our visitors.  Our only goal with this site is to provide guidance enriched by our 1:1 customer relationships for deploying Microsoft 365 Compliance products.  Therefore we elected to not collect any site analytics upon initial release.  

However, over a short period of time, we learned that certain metrics are needed to better understand how many users are visiting our site, how many are or are not finding it useful, and what content is popular so that we can continue to provide guidance that is useful.  Since we still want to be privacy-focused, we decided to use a 3rd party open source analytics solution called Plausible Analytics, which is GDPR, CCPA and PECR compliant.  **Plausible does not use cookies to track visitors and all data is aggregate only.** 

For more information, please view the Plausible data policy here: [https://plausible.io/data-policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy)

We also are currently testing an open source analytics project from Microsoft called [Clarity](https://clarity.microsoft.com).  Clarity by default does use cookies for collecting movement from page to page, however we have disabled this functionality.

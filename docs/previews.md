**New Features to Test!**

We are excited to on-board you to the Compliance preview program.

## Steps for joining a preview program

1. A private Teams channel is the main communication for all preview programs. Request access to this channel via [https://aka.ms/MIPC/JoinPreviews](https://aka.ms/MIPC/JoinPreviews).

1. Each preview is discussed in a dedicated channel that is exposed based on preview registration to the specific program.

1. Some preview channels are private and visible just for registered customers. Don't worry if you don't see the channel you are looking for. It means you are not registered to any preview yet. Each available private preview is announced in the "Preview Notifications" channel, with a link to a form to fill out to request joining the preview (if applicable).

1. Please verify you publish new posts in the correct channel for each preview.

Now available for testing in both Information Governance and Records Management solutions
The long awaited feature is here. 

## What is the feature?

Today, we are  announcing the private preview for adaptive policy scopes. This new functionality allows admins to create attribute-based retention or label policies that can be scoped to geography, department, or other user, group, or site attributes. 


## Improvements and key benefits:

* Ability to create different types of adaptive scopes – Create adaptive scopes for users, sites and groups based on attributes. For example, a user scope can be created based on attributes like Department, Country, Title and many more while site scopes can be created using site names, site URLs or SharePoint property bags.

* Ability to apply more than one type of adaptive scope to a retention or a label policy – Can apply more than one type of scope/s (user/site/group) to a retention policy or a label policy.

* Policy lookup – Can now look up a specific user, site or a group to see the list of all the policies that are applied.

* Policy reporting – Can view a report of who is covered by a policy (user/site/group), history of coverage and/or removal.

* Scope reporting – Similar to policy reporting, can also view a report of all the changes that happen to user, site and group scopes.

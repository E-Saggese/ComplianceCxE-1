## In This Episode

In this episode, we will start with the Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) Sensitivity Labels for containers classification and protection. We will go through our SBD classification taxonomy for container recap and configuration. Moreover, we will go over the main differences between content labels (as discussed in the last two episodes) and container labels, and how to use and configure (step-by-step) container labels. Also how to configure different protection methods and privacy settings on those container labels.

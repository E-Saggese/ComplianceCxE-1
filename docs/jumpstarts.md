## What are Jump Start Guides?

Jump starts are guides that we've created to help get started with a feature right away.  Their purpose is to achieve a specific goal while considering best practices and guidance specified in our [Deployment Acceleration Guides (DAGs)](https://microsoft.github.io/ComplianceCxE/dag/).

## How can I get started?

Choose an available guide and follow along to implement within your own environment.

## Can I contribute to Jump Start guides?

Yes! All content on the OSS is open source and can be contributed to by anyone. Refer to [how to contribute](https://microsoft.github.io/ComplianceCxE/how-to-contribute/) for more information.

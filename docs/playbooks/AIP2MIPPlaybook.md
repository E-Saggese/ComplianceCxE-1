# From bolt-on to built-in ‚Äì Migrate from Azure Information Protection Add-in 

## Overview

Office apps have supported sensitivity labels [since September 2018](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/azure-information-protection-is-now-generally-available/ba-p/249974), starting in Office for PC, using [Azure Information Protection (AIP) Add-in](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/rms-client/aip-clientv2). In October 2019, Office apps started providing the [same functionality built into Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-office-apps#support-for-sensitivity-label-capabilities-in-apps) and expanded sensitivity labels across Mac, Web, and Mobile for comprehensive, consistent, and seamless experience for end-users and admins.

## Built-In Instead of Bolt-On

Built-in labeling forms the cornerstone of a [Microsoft Purview information protection deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/information-protection-solution?view=o365-worldwide) it extends across platforms (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and web), as well as across Microsoft apps and services, and beyond. Built-in labeling is also designed to work with other Microsoft Purview capabilities, such as data classification and Microsoft Purview data loss prevention (DLP).

Customers benefited from the choice between the AIP add-in or the built-in native labeling [depending on the features they needed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-aip?view=o365-worldwide#feature-parity-for-built-in-labeling-and-the-aip-add-in-for-office-apps), but this also created challenges and tradeoffs for organizations:

| Add-In Limitations | Degrades end-user productivity and satisfaction |  Higher cost for IT
|:---|:---|:---|
| üîì Add-in can be disabled by end-users, leaving your data potentially vulnerable.<br>üõë Add-in features are ‚Äúfrozen in time‚Äù since December 2021 at the start of its maintenance period. | üê¢ Like most add-ins, AIP regularly impacts end-user productivity because of performance implications with the add-in. <br>üì± Users of Office on other platforms face inconsistencies with sensitivity labeling since the Add-in only supports Office for PC. | ‚öôÔ∏è AIP Add-in requires separate configuration, deployment, and management from the rest of the admin experience.|

Read the blog ‚Äú[From bolt-on to built-in information protection in Microsoft 365 Apps](https://aka.ms/AIP2MIP/Newsletter)‚Äù for an overview about this change.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Up until recently, built-in labeling was turned off by default in Office for Windows apps when the AIP client was installed. This default will no longer be the case for newer versions of Office. Soon, the built-in labeling will become the default. Learn more about the [change of default labeling client and how to configure your preferred labeling client](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-aip).


> üí° Tip: You can continue using all other tools in the AIP client, such as the Scanner, PowerShell extensions, or Windows right-click extension Classify & Protect. These tools are not affected by disabling the add-in inside Office and continue to be the recommended tools for all your sensitivity labeling scenarios that aren‚Äôt available within the Office apps.

# Migrating from WIP to Microsoft Purview for more comprehensive and powerful data security in your organization
Microsoft has announced sunset of certain capabilities within the solution known as Windows Information Protection (WIP), previously referred to as Enterprise Data Protection (EDP) by the end of Q3CY24. Below we will share more details about the scope of the deprecation and our recommendations to leverage Microsoft Purview Information Protection and Data Loss Prevention for your multi-cloud and multi-platform data protection needs. Microsoft Purview goes beyond WIP capabilities and provides more granular enforcement actions and classification techniques – Sensitive Info Types, Exact Data Match, and ML driven trainable classifiers can be used. Unlike WIP, Purview is also not limited to Windows devices as it also supports macOS. 

## How does deprecation impact WIP users?
WIP as an offering is no longer under active feature development. The sunset process will follow the standard Windows client feature lifecycle, which shows which existing features and capabilities are supported and for what timelines. This was announced in July here. 
Following this deprecation announcement, the Microsoft Endpoint Manager team announced ending support for WIP without enrollment scenario by EOY 2022, which only impacts unmanaged devices. The announcement by the Microsoft Endpoint Manager team is here. Please visit the Microsoft Endpoint Manager announcement for the latest on the decommissioning of MEM’s support for the ‘unenrolled’ scenario.

## How should you respond to the deprecation notice?
If you are using WIP without enrollment, Microsoft will be communicating with you directly about the impact to your devices and the timelines for that impact. Please keep an eye on the message center for the latest updates.
Microsoft Endpoint Manager will continue to support WIP with enrollment (managed devices) scenarios for the duration of the OS lifecycle (until 2026) and will continue to offer options to enroll both corporate and personal devices for management (and subsequently to receive WIP policy).

## Common WIP Protection features
WIP provided customers with the following key capabilities:
•	Extend data protection to managed and unmanaged devices
•	Protect enterprise data at rest when it's stored on a protected device
•	Restrict which apps, removable drives, printers, network shares, and sites are allowed or restricted from copying, accessing, and storing sensitive data
•	Classify data based upon the app or site where it was created, copied, or downloaded.
•	Granular controls to designate different levels of data access restrictions
•	Remote wipe sensitive data at rest

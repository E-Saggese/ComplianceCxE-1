## Overview

While built-in sensitivity labels closely replicate the functionality implemented in the AIP Add-in for Office, there are some specific differences in user interface and behavior which you should communicate to your users in advance of the change to minimize confusion and disruption. 

To help you evaluate the changes that you need to prepare for, the [Comparison Guide](CompareAIP2MIP.md) provides a simple ranking of each feature's change-management complexity and links to per-feature Change Guides with screenshots and reference material.


## Checklist

- Use the [Migration Effort](CompareAIP2MIP.md) estimates in the comparion guide to evaluate your change-management needs
- Check back with the [Comparison Guide](CompareAIP2MIP.md) often for new Change Guides that provide side-by-side comparisons of the main functionality for each feature between the AIP Add-in and built-in labeling.
- Join a [preview program](PreviewAIP2MIP.md) to get prepare screenshots or language-specific user communication. Leverage support documentation for [admins](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-office-apps?view=o365-worldwide) or [end-users](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/apply-sensitivity-labels-to-your-files-and-email-in-office-2f96e7cd-d5a4-403b-8bd7-4cc636bae0f9).

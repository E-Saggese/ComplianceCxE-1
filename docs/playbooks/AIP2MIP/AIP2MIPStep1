Built-In sensitivity labels require a subscription for M365 Apps for Enterprise. 

The first step in preparing your migration to built-in labeling from the AIP Add-in is to verify that all its users are appropriately licensed.

### How to evaluate licensing requirements for built-in sensitivity labeling
If your users are fully licensed for M365 Apps for Enterprise, proceed to step 2. Otherwise, follow this checklist to plan your migration.
1. [Review](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-applications-service-description/office-applications-service-description#feature-availability) the availability of Microsoft Purview Information Protection - manual sensitivity labeling or Microsoft Purview Information Protection - automatic sensitivity labeling.
2. If users of the AIP Add-In are not licensed for M365 Apps for Enterprise, investigate if they are covered under Office Software Assurance.
3. Contact your Microsoft account team or contact support if you need help.

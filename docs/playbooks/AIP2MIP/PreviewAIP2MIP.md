## Overview 
The best way to prepare for enabling the built-in labeling client is to get started today and try it out in your environment. We recommend deploying one of the available previews to subsets of your users and give feedback to Microsoft.

## Preview programs
Microsoft offers 3 preview channels to help you try information protection capabilities in M365 Apps. This gives you the opportunity to evaluate upcoming features early and provide feedback to the product team.

By participating in this program,  you get access to webinars, trainings, demos, and expertise from the product group. | Start |

## Overview
The third step in preparing your migration is to evaluate the readiness of your information protection policies to transition to the built-in labeling solution in Office.

Many of the capabilities of the AIP Add-in are [already supported in the built-in labeling experience](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-aip?view=o365-worldwide#feature-parity-for-built-in-labeling-and-the-aip-add-in-for-office-apps) in M365 Apps for Enterprise. Over the new few months, we will continue to deliver improvements and new capabilities in the built-in client. 

> üí° Tip: Tune-in to the [Office sensitivity labels newsletter](https://aka.ms/AIP2MIP/Newsletter) to stay up-to-date with what's new and coming soon for information protection in Office apps

> Note: By enabling the built-in labeling client in M365 Apps, you can continue to use the [AIP Scanner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/deploy-aip-scanner), [AIP PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide-powershell), or [AIP Classify and Protect](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/rms-client/clientv2-classify-protect#use-the-file-explorer-to-classify-and-protect-files).

## Checklist
If your all the capabilities you use in the AIP Add-in are already supported, proceed to [Step 4](AIP2MIPStep4.md). Otherwise, follow the checklist below.

- [Evaluate support](CompareAIP2MIP.md) for your AIP-based information protection policies in built-in labeling. 
- If all your policies are `‚úÖ Supported` or `‚¨õ Not Needed`, **migrate to the built-in labeling today**. Got to [Step 5](AIP2MIPStep5.md) to learn how to enable the built-in labeling client. 
- If any must-have capabilities are `‚≠ê In Preview` or `üî∑ In Development`, start planning your migration now. Most of these capabilities will be available in [Current Channel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/overview-update-channels#current-channel-overview) in an estimated **3-6 months time horizon**. Review each feature's roadmap for specific timelines. [Join a preview program](PreviewAIP2MIP.md) to start evaluating these capabilities.
- If any must-have capabilities are `üü® In Planning`, consider piloting supported features in a [preview program](PreviewAIP2MIP.md) while you prepare for remaining capabilities to be supported over a **6-12 months time horizon**.
- If any must-have capabilities are `‚ö´ Not Planned`, evaluate the [AIP Scanner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/deploy-aip-scanner), [AIP PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide-powershell), or [AIP Classify and Protect](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/rms-client/clientv2-classify-protect#use-the-file-explorer-to-classify-and-protect-files) to replace the functionality you were using the AIP Add-in.

When you're ready, proceed to [Step 4Ô∏è‚É£](AIP2MIPStep4.md).

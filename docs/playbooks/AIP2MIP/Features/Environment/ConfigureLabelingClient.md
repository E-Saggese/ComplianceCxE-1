# Configure Labeling Clients for Office 

`‚úÖ Supported | ‚ö™‚ö™üî¥ Major Change`

Office apps allow you to configure which which labeling client is used to view and apply sensitivity labels with Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook.

## Product Capabilities
The table below lists the main characteristics of this feature and its comparison across the AIP Add-in vs. the built-in labeling solution. These are mapped to product screenshots in the next section. 

|  | Use Case             | Add-In| Built-In (Current) | Built-In (Coming Soon)|
| :----                   | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | **Disable Microsoft Information Protection (All)**   | `‚úÖ Supported`  | `‚úÖ Supported` No change | `‚úÖ Supported` No change  |
| 2 | **Use built-in labeling by default**   | `‚úÖ Supported` If you uninstal the AIP client, built-in labeling will load instead of add-in | `‚úÖ Supported` If you set regkey `UseOfficeForLabelling==true`, built-in labeling loads instead of the add-in | `‚úÖ Supported` No change  |
| 3 | **Use add-in labeling by default**    | `‚úÖ Supported` When the add-in is installed, it sets itself as the default labeling client for Office | `‚úÖ Supported` If you set regkey `UseOfficeForLabelling==false`, add-in labeling loads instead of the built-in if it's installed | `‚≠ê In Preview` You must  deploy regkey `AIPException==true` to continue using add-in |

## Migration Guidance
    !!! note
        If you've previously configured `UseOfficeForLabelling==false` to enable the AIP add-in for Office, users will be unable to view or apply labels after `Current Channel v2211`. You must  deploy regkey `AIPException==true` to continue using add-in.

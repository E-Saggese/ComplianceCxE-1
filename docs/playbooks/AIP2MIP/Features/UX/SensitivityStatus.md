## Migration Guidelines
When transitioning from the add-in to the built-in labeling solution for Office, consider the following migration guidelines.
- `IT ðŸŸ¢âšªâšª Silent Change`: There's no change required for compliance admins when replacing the add-in with built-in labeling for this feature.
- `IW âšªðŸŸ¡âšª Minor Change`: The sensitivity status is hidden by default in the application status bar. This is because it's placement in the status bar is often missed by end-users and is dupicative with the label status in the sensitivity bar near the document title.

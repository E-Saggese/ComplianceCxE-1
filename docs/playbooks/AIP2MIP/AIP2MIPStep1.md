## Overview
The first step in preparing your migration to built-in labeling from the AIP Add-in is to verify that all its users are appropriately licensed for the versions of Office that support built-in labeling.

Built-in labels require a subscription edition of Office apps. If you have standalone editions of Office, sometimes called "Office Perpetual", you'll need to first upgrade to Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise to benefit from the latest labeling capabilities.

## Checklist
If your users are fully licensed for M365 Apps for Enterprise, proceed to [step 2](AIP2MIPStep2.md). Otherwise, follow this checklist to plan your migration.

- Contact your Microsoft account team or contact support if you need help
